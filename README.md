### A bit about me

- I'm 30-something father of two little boys whose wonder fills me with wonder.

- I'm a Data Scientist with [Gensler](https://www.gensler.com/) where I direct People Analytics, Collaborate with the Research Institute, and help teams around the company figure out how data, analytics, and machine learning can add value. 

- I'm a mathematician who is convinced that all of the exotic structures I learned about through entirely too much school can actually be useful in solving real people's real problems.

- I'm a programmer, I like to work in Go and Python. 

- I'm Head Cheerleader at [Harness Labs](https://github.com/harnesslabs) 

### Things I've done

- Modernized People Analytics at JBS USA. We implemented their first ML system in the form of a predictive attrition suite.

- I earned an MS in Mathematics from Colorado State University.

- Earned a BA in Mathematics, Economics and International studies at the University of Denver.

- Won the Herbert J. Greenberg Award for Excellence in Mathematics at University of Denver
  
- Lived and worked in Sierra Leone for a couple of years where I helped start on non-profit and did some water projects.
