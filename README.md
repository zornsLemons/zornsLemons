### A bit about me

- I'm 30-something father of two little boys whose wonder fills me with wonder.

- I'm a Data Scientist with [Gensler](https://www.gensler.com/) where I lead People Analytics, Collaborate with the Research Institute, and help teams around the company figure out how data, analytics, and machine learning can add value. 

- I'm a mathematician who is convinced that all of the exotic structures I learned about through entirely too much school can actually be useful in solving real people's real problems.

- I'm a mediocre programmer though thanks to [Jeff](https://github.com/thelnar) I write passable python now.

- I'm happy to be a collaborator of [Colin](https://autoparallel.xyz) and [Harness Labs](https://github.com/harnesslabs) (maybe one day I'll learn enough rust to contribute something useful)

### Things I've done

- Originated a tech focused People Analytics team at JBS USA. We implemented their first ML system in the form of a predictive attrition suite.

- I earned an MS in Mathematics from CSU before dropping out of my PhD program in favor of having kids and supporting them.

- Earned a BA in Mathematics, Economics and International studies at the University of Denver. I won their highest departmental award on my way out the door. 

- Lived and worked in Sierra Leone for a couple of years where I helped start on non-profit and did some water projects.
